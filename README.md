#TwinTacToe || Lactao, Edneil P. & Muldera, Ezekiel John O. || Software Design Lab Quiz 1

A. Game overview:
Twin-tac-toe is an innovative twist on the classic Tic Tac Toe game, introducing dual 3x3 grids to intensify the gameplay experience. Players take turns placing their respective symbols (X and O) on either of the two grids, aiming to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on one of the grids to secure a win. The game features real-time score tracking across multiple rounds, allowing for extended competitive play. A player can also go against a computer by simply setting the name for Player 2 as "COMPUTER."

B. Setup instructions:
   i. Ensure you have a code editor like Visual Studio installed to run the code
   ii. Clone the repository: Copy this repository’s URL and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project via Git Bash. 
   iii. Open the project in Visual Studio.
   iv. Build the Solution by selecting “Build Solution” in the “Build” menu to ensure that there are no errors during the build process.
   v. Select “Start Debugging” to run the game. Wait for the game window to appear, then enjoy the game.

            
C. Technical Dependencies:
The game is built to work on Windows (7, 8, 10, or later) and it can run without additional software installations. Basic or standard computer specifications are sufficient for running the game.

D. Compatibility Information:
Twin-tac-toe is designed to run on computers, making the game easily enjoyed on desktops and laptops. However, its lack of responsive design results in a poor user experience on smaller screens such as mobile devices (not recommended).
